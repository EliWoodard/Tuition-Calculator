# Tuition-Calculator

This is a Java program that calculates the total tuition, fees, and cost for a specified number of semesters, based on the user's input of the cost of a regular credit, the cost of an overloaded credit, and the maximum number of credits without being considered overloaded. The program assumes the user is an undergraduate and not a resident.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `Main.java` file is located.
3. Compile the program by typing `javac Main.java` and pressing Enter.
4. Run the program by typing `java Main` and pressing Enter.
5. Enter the cost of a regular credit, the cost of an overloaded credit, and the maximum number of credits without being considered overloaded. If no values are entered, the default values will be used.
6. Enter the number of semesters you want to calculate.
7. Enter the number of credits for each semester.
8. Enter any additional fees you want to add. If no fees are entered, only the tuition values will be displayed.

The program will output the total tuition, fees, and cost for the specified number of semesters, based on the user's input.
